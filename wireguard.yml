  #   Important : Please note: don't wrap the generated hash password in single quotes 
  #   when you use docker-compose.yml. 
  #   Instead, replace each $ symbol with two $$ symbols. For example:
  #    - PASSWORD_HASH=$$2y$$10$$hBCoykrB95WSzuV4fafBzOHWKu9sbyVa34GJr8VV5R/pIelfEMYyG
  #      This hash is for the password 'foobar123', obtained using the command docker 
  #    run ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw foobar123 and then inserted an additional $ before 
  #    each existing $ symbol.
